# Ultimate Spawn List

This is (hopefully) an exhaustive list of optimal spawns for all categories of Minecraft speedrunning, in the mc, mcce and mc_juice boards, with currently 51 categories supported.

The list is made for the [setspawn mod](https://github.com/Minecraft-Java-Edition-Speedrunning/mcsr-set-spawn-1.16.1) (only available for 1.15.2, 1.16.1, 1.16.5 and 1.17.1 at the time of writing), and has the goal of making this mod's usage seamless.
It must be pasted in the `config` folder of your minecraft instance.

If spawns are not working or not optimal, or if you'd like another seed to be added, just create a new issue or DM me on Discord (Baryllium#3810).

Known issues:
- the spawn for Zombie Doctor doesn't work, and i don't know why
